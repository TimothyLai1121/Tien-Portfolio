# Tien-Portfolio

My Introduction for my challenge 1 assignment

## Introduction
My name is Tien Ton. You can call me Tim for short or you can pronounce my name Tien by simply watching Dragon Ball Z. I do not have a third eye however. I will be using this repo to present my current knowledge on HTML and CSS so far on my first week of GeorgiaTEch BootCamp.

## Resources & Tools
I will be utilizing Terminal on MacOS to create directories and initiate my Visual Code Studio from directories desired.
I will be using GitHub to push and pull my repository.
I will be utilizing my CodeCademy Pro by speedrun through the course again. This class does require more than 20 hours plus of commitment therefore I think it will be fun by throwing it in

## What Did I learned through this challenge



## Terminal Process

![Step 01 Directories](/assets/Step-01-Directories/images/Step-01.png)

- Step 1. Open Terminal
- Step 2. Change my directories into folder I want to work on
- Step 3. $\color{#00FF00}{mkdir}$ (making folders) by the name "Challenge 01" and cd to Challenge-1 folder
- Step 4. git clone my repo on my github and type in $\color{#00FF00}{code~.}$ to open Visual Code Studio

###### Fun Facts about README.md
It also have a programming language. I just discovered this while working on this project.
You can also change your text font on README.md by typing " $\color{#00FF00}{your-text-here}$ "

## HTML Creating
Once I opened Visual Studio Code, I used the terminal of the VS to type in $\color{#00FF00}{$\color{#00FF00}{touch~index.html}$ }$ to create a index.html

## CSS Creating
