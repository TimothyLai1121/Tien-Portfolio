# Tien-Portfolio
My Introduction for my challenge 1 assign

## Introduction
My name is Tien Ton. You can call me Tim for short or you can pronounce my name Tien by simply watching Dragon Ball Z. I do not have a third eye however. I will be using this repo to present my current knowledge on HTML and CSS so far on my first week of GeorgiaTEch BootCamp.

## Resources & Tools
I will be utilizing Terminal on MacOS to create directories and initiate my Visual Code Studio from directories desired.
I will be using GitHub to push and pull my repository.
I will be utilizing my CodeCademy Pro by speedrun through the course again. This class does require more than 20 hours plus of commitment therefore I think it will be fun by throwing it in

## What Did I learned through this challenge
